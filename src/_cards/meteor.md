Meteor is a JavaScript framework and the reason I fell in love with developing apps in the first place. It's single-stack approach made it crazy simple for self-taught folks like myself to quickly develop and launch web apps.

I particularly found it useful for those times I couldn't convince a SaaS startup with an API to create a feature. [Just create it yourself](https://github.com/chadokruse/sprintly-visualizer) :)
