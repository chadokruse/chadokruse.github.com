Before launching my own ventures and teaching myself to code, I was often brought on as the first "business hire" at startups of all shapes and sizes. I've built web applications, run development teams, owned product strategy, raised venture, seed, debt, and philanthropic capital, and closed business development deals with companies both large and small. I'm a generalist through and through.

My career started as a strategist and dealmaker for large tech companies.

My head is in SF, my heart is in Bend, Oregon, and my body is currently in Chicago.
