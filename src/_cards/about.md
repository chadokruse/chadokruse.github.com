I’m a Product Engineer and Full Stack Developer with a unique ability to bridge the gap between strategy, product, and development. I’ve worked at numerous early-stage startups, founded some of my own, and understand innovation at scale thanks to my time at four different Fortune 500 companies.

My career started as a strategist and dealmaker for large tech companies.

I'm currently on sabbatical to modernize [Grantmakers.io](http://Grantmakers.io), a passion project that continues to save nonprofits hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
