Forkfly (now CloudEngage) was an early entrant in the highly competitive location-based mobile space. As COO, I had the honor of building a world-class development team from the ground up, managed and launched three web apps and two mobile platforms, and prioritized a seemingly endless feature list. I brought the company to first revenues and helped lead overall strategy development.
