Saava.org was a sabbatical experiment I created, ultimately growing to 35 local, accredited investors. Members explored investment opportunities in mission-related organizations, from smart growth real estate funds to cleantech upstarts and non-profits developing earned-income streams. Our purpose: making money and making the world a better place shouldn't be mutually exclusive.
