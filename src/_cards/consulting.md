I'm an analyst - an expert in connecting dots. Much of my current consulting work involves helping organizations justify investments. For government-related entities, these investments are often growth-related, and in emerging fields like cybersecurity. Some call it econometrics; I simply call it using numbers to educate important decisions. E.g. for every $1 spent, expect $XX dollars in economic benefit over Y years.
