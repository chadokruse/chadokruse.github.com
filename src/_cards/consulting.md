I'm an analyst - an expert in connecting dots. Much of my current consulting work involves helping organizations justify investments (e.g. for every $1 spent, $XX in economic benefit will be generated). For government-related entities, these investments are often growth-related and in emerging fields like cybersecurity. Some call it econometrics; I simply call it using numbers to educate important decisions.
