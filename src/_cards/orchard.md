I had a decision to make. The space I was excited about wouldn't hit the zeitgeist for many years - bad market timing already left a long line of startup casualties. Besides, I needed to learn Node.js and strengthen my coding skills. But I also needed health insurance and ramen money. ðŸ¤”

So I rolled up my sleeves and did the **exact opposite** of what every other bootstrapper would do: I opted for a part-time gig at Apple so I could focus on the venture nearly full-time instead of the reverse. Incredible five years working with some of the most intelligent, dedicated workers ever.
