**JavaScript** remains my primary language.

NodeJS on the backend, Tailwind for styling, and MongoDB for document stores. I'm frontend framework agnostic, having worked with React, Vue, and Svelte, grounded in a solid foundation of vanilla JS.

The bulk of my cloud experience is with GCP, I dip into AWS when needed, and have worked with Azure professionally. I am currently most intrigued by Cloudflare's services, especially Workers, R2, and Workers AI.
