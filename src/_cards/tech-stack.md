**JavaScript** remains my primary language.

I'm best known as a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/) developer for my work on Grantmakers.io, which pushes the boundaries of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.

The site uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [MongoDB Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/realm) for its dynamic components and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the upstream data pipelines.
