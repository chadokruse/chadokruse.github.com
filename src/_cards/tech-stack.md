**JavaScript** remains my primary language. **Node.js** for scripting and backend, and **Vue.js** when a front-end framework is needed. 

**Jekyll** is my go-to SSG and I love me the **Jamstack**. I'd love to see **Gridsome** hit v1, but I'm currently most enamored with **11ty** and **Tailwind**.

**Google Cloud Platform** for all things cloud, **bash** when I need it, and the **AWS S3 SDK** for accessing public datasets.

**MongoDB** is my preferred database. **MongoDB Atlas** when it's cost-effective, otherwise self-hosted. I also use their **MongoDB Realm** product to a smaller extent.
