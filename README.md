##A Jekyll-Powered Portfolio Site##
This is the source code used to power my personal site [chadkruse.com](http://www.chadkruse.com). It's based on Grid-a-licious, a js plugin that I'd call a precursor to the tile layout made popular by Pinterest (Grid-a-licious was first dammit!).

You may find this project useful for visually showcasing past work history to complement your LinkedIn profile or resume. Might work for photography and design portfolios as well.

*Note: All of the usual blog templates/functionality have been gutted, so if it's a blog you seek, this might not be the right sample project for you.*

###Usage###
1. I'm assuming you already know how to get a Jekyll site up and running. I'll try to add a more detailed tutorial shortly, but if you're on a mac here are two good tutorials for installing all the necessary dependencies: [#1](http://andytaylor.me/2012/11/03/installing-ruby-and-jekyll/), [#2](http://brandonbohling.com/2011/08/Installing-Jekyll-on-Mac/). Then, read [this tutorial](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/) to get your project up on Github and on the interwebernets.
2. I do things differently than most Jekyll templates because I wanted to control the order of the tiles (there are many ways to do thisâ€¦I happen to choose this method). 
3. All of the tiles are _includes (see `_includes/tiles`). Create your tiles there.
3. Your main landing page is `index.html`. In it you'll find a reference to the `filtered-pages` folder. This folder contains three pages, which correspond to the three filter links in the subnav. In my case, they are `All`, `Social Ventures`, and `Technology Ventures`. Clicking on any of those makes an AJAX call to refresh the tiles without refreshing the whole page. A slightly better user experience IMHO. You can have as many filter tabs as you want.
4. Create your grid of tiles by listing the appropriate include:  
`{% include tiles/about.html %}` in the order you want them to appear.
5. Update the href's in the filter bar (`_includes/header.html`) to match the naming convention in your `filtered-pages` folder. Example: `<li><a class="filter" href="/technology-ventures/">Tech Ventures</a></li>`
5. Replace my Google Analytics ID with your own in `_includes/body-scripts.html`
6. Delete the `CNAME` file. If you want a custom domain, follow [the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) to do so. If you get stuck, read Github's [troubleshooting](suggestions).
7. Update `robots.txt` if you care about such things.
