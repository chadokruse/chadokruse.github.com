            COO + Biz Dev Lead
        </div>

        <div class="contentIndex">
            <p>I served as COO for innovative sensor startup GreenGoose during a critical time in the company's history, partnering with the solo founder after a successful seed round but still during the prototype phase.</p>

            <p>My role changed on a daily (if not hourly) basis, but ranged from crafting the go-to-market strategy and product definition, to early business development and fundraising.</p>
