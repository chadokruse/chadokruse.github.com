            <p><a href="http://www.cfainstitute.org/cfaprog/">The CFA Program</a> (think CPA for the finance world) is something I enrolled in back in 1997 (just out of undergrad) and will finish up by taking the final exam as soon as I scrape together enough free time (Level III).</p>

            <p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is something I had been tinkering around on for a few months in my free time a few years back, and the reason I still have yet to sit for the final CFA exam.</p>

            <p>That might possibly make me the only CFA-type that can write an API call in Rails.</p>
