            Applying Technology to Offline Markets
        </div>

        <div class="contentIndex">
            <p>This was a spin-out idea stemming from my work in conservation-based forestry. The beauty of working with offline businesses is uncovering countless opportunities to apply technology...this was one of those scenarios. With a focus on the small forestland landowner, we developed a system that intended to leverage LIDAR and satellite technologies to inventory ecosystem assets on ALL non-industrial, private forestlands in OR &amp; WA (we're talking millions of acres here). If successful, the platform could disrupt the entire forest products supply chain in Western North America.</p>

            <p>That's the good news. The bad news is the technology behind the data sets isn't quite there yet, at least not in a way that scales (but lots of smart people are cranking on it as we speak).</p>
