        <div class="contentIndex">
            <p>One of the first startups involved in social commerce, I consulted with Bonanza (formerly Bonanzle) during its bootstrap phase. I served the role of "business guy" with duties generally focused on business partnerships and API evangelism, but also included product management, strategy, data mining, and managing the company's first ad campaign.</p>

            <p>Great working relationship with the technical co-founder, offloading certain tasks to allow him to fully concentrate on the user experience. The company subsequently raised a $1M first round from a variety of Seattle-based VCs and super angels and continues to kick *ss.</p>
