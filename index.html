                <div class="contentIndex">
                	<p>Before launching my own ventures and dabbling with code, I was often brought on as the first "business hire" at startups of all shapes and sizes, online and offline. I've run development teams, launched mobile apps, raised venture, seed, and debt capital, and closed business development deals with companies both large and small. I'm a generalist through and through.</p>
                	<p>My career started as a strategist and dealmaker for large tech companies, and I'm often told I have a unique ability to talk shop with programmers, private equity types, philanthropists, and everyone in between.</p>

                    <p>Philanthropy shouldn't have to be done in the dark. As Ev Williams puts it, "the sharing of ideas and experiences is what moves humanity forward."

                    <p>This was a spin-out idea stemming from my work in conservation-based forestry. The beauty of working with offline businesses is uncovering countless opportunities to apply technology...this was one of those scenarios. With a focus on the small forestland landowner, we developed a system that intended to leverage LIDAR and satellite technologies to inventory ecosystem assets on ALL non-industrial, private forestlands in OR &amp; WA (we're talking millions of acres here). If successful, the platform could disrupt the entire forest products supply chain in Western North America.</p>

                    <p>That's the good news. The bad news is the technology behind the data sets isn't quite there yet, at least not in a way that scales (but lots of smart people are cranking on it as we speak).</p>
