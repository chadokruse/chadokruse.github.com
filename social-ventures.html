                    <p>Philanthropy shouldn't have to be done in the dark. As Ev Williams puts it, "the sharing of ideas and experiences is what moves humanity forward." At Kyn, we're rethinking modern philanthropy systems to bring simplicity, passion, and a personal connection to each and every charitable gift.</p>

                    <p>Saava was part experiment, part informal network of individual investors, foundations, lenders, and resource providers. Members explored investment opportunities in mission-related organizations, using the Saava website to collaborate with other like-minded investors.</p>

                    <p>I incubated and launched the project while on sabbatical ($7k all in...talk about lean), eventually reaching 35 local, accredited investors. The organization facilitated the review of over 60 Porltand-based organizations seeking capital, from smart growth real estate funds to cleantech upstarts and non-profits developing earned-income streams.</p>

                    Applying Technology to Offline Markets

                <div class="contentIndex">
                    <p>This was a spin-out idea stemming from my work in conservation-based forestry. The beauty of working with offline businesses is uncovering countless opportunities to apply technology...this was one of those scenarios. With a focus on the small forestland landowner, we developed a system that intended to leverage LIDAR and satellite technologies to inventory ecosystem assets on ALL non-industrial, private forestlands in OR &amp; WA (we're talking millions of acres here). If successful, the platform could disrupt the entire forest products supply chain in Western North America.</p>

                    <p>That's the good news. The bad news is the technology behind the data sets isn't quite there yet, at least not in a way that scales (but lots of smart people are cranking on it as we speak).</p>
