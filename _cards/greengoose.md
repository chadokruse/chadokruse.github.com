I served as COO for innovative sensor startup GreenGoose during a critical time in the company's history, partnering with the solo founder after a successful seed round but still during the prototype phase.

My role changed on a daily (if not hourly) basis, but ranged from crafting the go-to-market strategy and product definition, to early business development and fundraising.
