**Execution:** I'm a firm believer that ideas are cheap, execution is everything. I enjoy partnering with growth-oriented organizations and other domain experts to help turn ideas into reality.

**Roadmaps & Strategy:** I help organizations ensure they're building the right things for the right reasons. For existing businesses, my value-add is centered on exploring new markets - intrapreneurship can be incredibly powerful when done right.</p>

**Seed Stage Companies:** My consulting work with seed-stage founders centers on creating business models and developing paths to that first customer (or investor, or partner).
