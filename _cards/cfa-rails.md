Quite possibly nothing, except&hellip;

[The CFA Program](http://www.cfainstitute.org/cfaprog/) (think CPA for the finance world) is something I enrolled in back in 1997 (just out of undergrad) and will finish up by taking the final exam as soon as I scrape together enough free time (Level III).

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is something I had been tinkering around on for a few months in my free time a few years back, and the reason I still have yet to sit for the final CFA exam.

That might possibly make me the only CFA-type that can write an API call in Rails.
