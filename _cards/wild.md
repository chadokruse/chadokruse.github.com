In partnership with one of the most passionate domain experts I have met to date, I played a leadership role with the creation and eventual market launch of WiLD Forests I, L.P., a conservation-based timberland investment management fund. I lead corporate development, finance, and fundraising.

The firm uses a unique approach to forest management, leveraging carbon offsets, conservation easements, and other "ecosystem services" to monetize lands while maintaining healthy forests.
