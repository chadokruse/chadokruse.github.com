Saava was part experiment, part informal network of individual investors, foundations, lenders, and resource providers. Members explored investment opportunities in mission-related organizations, using the Saava website to collaborate with other like-minded investors.

I incubated and launched the project while on sabbatical, eventually reaching 35 local, accredited investors. The organization facilitated the review of over 60 Portland-based organizations seeking capital, from smart growth real estate funds to cleantech upstarts and non-profits developing earned-income streams.
