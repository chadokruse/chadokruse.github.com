Making money and making the world a better place shouldn't be mutually exclusive. I have been involved at the intersection of philanthropy and investing since 2003 (see also Saava.org).

Call it double or triple bottom line, mission or social investing, MRIs, PRIs, blended value...it simply makes sense.

I use this lens when approaching any business, be it startups, fund advisors, nonprofits, or manufacturing companies.
