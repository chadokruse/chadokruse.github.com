This was a spin-out idea stemming from my work in conservation-based forestry. The beauty of working with offline businesses is uncovering countless opportunities to apply technology...this was one of those scenarios. With a focus on the small forestland landowner, we developed a system that intended to leverage LIDAR and satellite technologies to inventory ecosystem assets on ALL non-industrial, private forestlands in OR &amp; WA (we're talking millions of acres here). If successful, the platform could disrupt the entire forest products supply chain in Western North America.

That's the good news. The bad news is the technology behind the data sets isn't quite there yet, at least not in a way that scales (but lots of smart people are cranking on it as we speak).
