Meteor is a javascript framework and my current programming crush. I quickly fell in love with how fast you can launch a web app and thus it is an integral part of my rapid prototyping toolbox.

I've also found it useful for those times I can't convince a SaaS startup with an API to create a feature. [Just create it yourself](https://github.com/chadokruse/sprintly-visualizer) :)
