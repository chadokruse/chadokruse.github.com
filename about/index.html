  üëã Hi! I'm Chad Kruse, a <span class="text-gray-800 font-bold">full stack developer</span>. I leverage my time as a former startup COO and corporate strategy pro to build open source products that help move the nonprofit world forward. The goal: Triple charitable giving in the world threefold.

  In my past life I had fancy titles like COO and things relating to Corporate Development and Strategy, but what makes me tick is leveraging technology to help move humanity forward.

  I jumped off the career track 5 years ago to teach myself to code. The goal: change the world. The result: The site I built and run has saved nonprofits millions of dollars, at no cost to anyone (including myself).

  Though my tools have changed over the years, I remain an expert in solving problems. My current toolset involves software engineering, but I started in financial engineering where my main tool was Excel. I then learned my ability to connect and communicate with people on a human level allowed me amplify my toolset in ways I never expected.

  I'm an expert in solving problems and connecting dots. First with Excel as a financial engineer, and now with JavaScript as a software engineer, I'm told what really sets me apart is my ability to connect with people on a human level.

  I'm an expert in solving problems and connecting dots. My career started as a financial engineer, with Excel as my primary tool. I moved into growth engineering through my work as a startup COO, with my ability to connect with people on a human level as my core strength.

  I dedicated the past 5 years to teach myself how to code to see if I can move the philanthropy world forward. I created and now run the world's largest free source of philanthropic data. Though I've saved nonprofits millions over the years, I have yet to figure out how to translate that into income for myself. I've come to realize it's not a zero-sum game. I can continue helping nonprofits while applying my software engineering skills to making a living. I appreciate your interest üôè.

  I jumped off the career track 5 years ago to teach myself to code. I was tired of trying to convince others what needed to be built to move humanity forward. So I built those tools myself. I've saved nonprofits millions of dollars over the years, primarily through my open source work with Grantmakers.io.
